# COEN390Project

Project created for an Android development course. The objective of the project is to create an Android application that communicates with sensors and hardware to decide on the proper course of action to achieve the desired result. In our case, our Android app communicates with a light sensor and determines when to open or close a set of curtains automatically. Other features were added such as opening and closing via a button in the app and UI elements to enhance the experience, such as scheduling (not functional).
